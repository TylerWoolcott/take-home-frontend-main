# Nossa Data Front-End Test

## About Nossa Data

Nossa Data is a VC-backed startup building a tool to accelerate companiesâ€™ ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) disclosures and improve the transparency and data quality of large enterprises. Our long term goal is to accelerate transparency on how companies interact with people and the planet.

Companies are getting put under a magnifying glass on everything from environmental impact, employee health and cyber security to their supply chain. This means that ESG performance has a big impact on how a company is perceived by investors, their cost of capital and ability to operate within newly formed regulation.

We are a closely knit team of 5 talented developers, ESG specialists and business specialists. We are looking to grow and increase our development capacity, in order to better serve our fast growing number of customers.
